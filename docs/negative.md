# Negative / Inconclusive Results

This document records all experimental routes tested but not adopted as mainline contributions in RNA-OmniPrefold.

| Route | Result | Evidence | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| RNA-FM distillation | Weak | Isolated contribution small; D-only matched teacher on toy data | Deleted |
| LLM semantic tokens | Negative | Pair F1 dropped from 0.5723 to 0.3851 | Not recovered |
| LLM preference (full-budget) | Inconclusive | 500-step: no-pref 0.2440, oracle pref 0.2447, RAG pref 0.2442 | Not mainline |
| Low-label | Confounded | same-step advantage was epoch exposure artifact | Not pursued |
| Fine-grained relation_mask | Insufficient | Only affects token denoising, not Pair BCE | Not mainline |
| PairLossPolicy / weighted BCE | Negative | Vectorized but hard_negative_weight=2.0 does not change F1 | Not continued |
| LLM architecture proposer | Suspended | Non-LLM search space too small | Not continued |
| LLM reranker (free) | Negative | F1=0.1025 vs Rule=0.1223 | Not valid module |
| LLM reranker (constrained) | Inconclusive | F1=0.1223 equals Rule, no added value | Not valid module |
| No-LLM structural tagaux | Negative | λ=0.03 unchanged (0.2009), λ=0.20 degrades (0.1899) | Not recommended |
| LLM structured tags / CLIP | Not entered | No-LLM tagaux showed no positive signal | Deferred |

## Details

### RNA-FM Distillation
Sequence-level teacher distillation tested as optional pretraining signal. Toy comparison: D-only and teacher both reached Pair F1 0.8333. Fine-tune val loss slightly worse with teacher (1.0245 vs 0.9643). Removed from mainline.

### LLM Semantic Tokens
Sample-level biological hints injected as condition tokens. Coverage low (most SEM_UNKNOWN). F1 dropped from 0.5723 to 0.3851. Conclusion: semantic tokens are not part of mainline.

### LLM Preference / RAG Preference
Low-beta (0.005) + warmup shows early-stage signal (+0.0121 at 300 steps). Full-budget (500 steps) shows negligible gain (+0.0007). Preference is not a cumulative performance booster.

### Low-label Confound
Low10 appeared to outperform full at same-step (0.1954 vs 0.1852). Same-epoch comparison corrected: low10 45 steps (0.1414) vs full 300 steps (0.1852). Artifact of imbalanced epoch exposure.

### PairLossPolicy
Implemented 100% vectorized weighted BCE with canonical/distance masks. hard_negative_weight=2.0 does not change Pair F1 from MS-MPRM baseline at 300 steps.

### LLM Reranker
Free LLM reranker (F1=0.1025) underperforms Rule Reranker (F1=0.1223). Constrained LLM equals Rule. Oracle Top-K upper bound exists (0.1490) but LLM cannot approach it.

### Structural Tag Auxiliary
Struct_aux infrastructure built. No-LLM tagaux at λ=0.03 unchanged from MS-MPRM. λ=0.20 degrades F1 to 0.1899. Auxiliary task interferes with Pair BCE.
